# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mofat Munene!

### About Me

I'm a Generative AI and Back-End Engineer with over 3 years of experience in Python. My journey from a retail cashier to an AI Tech Lead in just a few years is a testament to my passion for technology, continuous learning, and problem-solving.

I specialize in designing and building scalable, API-first solutions, with a strong focus on AI-driven applications and machine learning pipelines. I thrive on solving complex challenges and am always eager to learn new technologies that can deliver a tangible impact.

I am currently seeking a remote role where I can apply my skills in AI/ML, cloud platforms (Azure, AWS), and collaborative development to build innovative solutions for global challenges.

* ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Building and fine-tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for a new set of business challenges.
* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Advanced concepts in MLOps and cloud-native AI infrastructure.
* ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Python, Django, FastAPI, LLM integrations, or anything related to building scalable back-end and AI systems.
